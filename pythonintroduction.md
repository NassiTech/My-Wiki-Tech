# **Execute python code**
In *Visual studio code* create a .md data  
Open a file (_ .py) and write the code text with the specific characters 
## first commands 
first define the variables and assign them a class : 
### string = "text" . Select the definition and add a = sign. the argument of the name has to be into "".
 
 after defining all the variables use the python command.
-Every python command starts with an order : print, input, type, range, round, sort, install, def, del, return, loop  ... 
-print : needs brakets ( ) 

### numbers = 1, 2,... and their categories integer or decimal. They dont need to be into ""
 the operations are simply defined 
 addition +
 multiplication *
 division /
 rest of a division %
 if we  compare numbers we can write the assumption and we get an answer in a logic form : TRUE/FALSE 
 == means equal 
 != not equal
 greater > 
 smaller <
 greater or equal >=
 smaller or equal <=

after writing the code -> next step 
go on "toggle panel" button and open the lower panel
select in launch **WSL Ubuntu** terminal und check if there is a python and if yes which version is installed. command :  **python3** to find python installation and 
 **python3 --version** for the version.
 In the WSL panel, tipe the name of the script with (_.py) extension to execute the commands in python with the ENTER key.
 The result appears like this  

Visual Studio command
first_name = "Nassima"
last_name = "A."
print(first_name + " " + last_name)

WSL version 
Nassima A.
______________
 For numbers and easy operations + * / 

number1 = 3
number2 = 15
print("number1" + "number2", number1 + number2)
print("number1* number2" , number1 * number2)
print("number2/number1:" , number2 / number1)

number1 + number2 18
number1* number2 45
number2/number1 5.0
